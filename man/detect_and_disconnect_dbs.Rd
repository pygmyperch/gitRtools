\description{
Scans the global environment for database connections and safely disconnects them.

}
\details{
This function searches the global environment for objects that appear to be
database connections, including:
\itemize{
  \item DBI connections (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
  \item Objects with common connection names (con, db, conn, database)
  \item Any object that responds to DBI::dbIsValid()
}

For each detected connection, it will:
\itemize{
  \item Report the variable name and connection type
  \item Check if the connection is still valid
  \item Safely disconnect if requested
  \item Provide summary information
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Just detect and report (no disconnection)
detect_and_disconnect_dbs(disconnect = FALSE)

# Detect and disconnect all found connections
detect_and_disconnect_dbs()

# Silent operation
detect_and_disconnect_dbs(verbose = FALSE)
}
